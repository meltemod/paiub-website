This [NIH-funded](https://iuni.iu.edu/projects/doctor-shopping) collaborative project assess network-based measures to analyze patterns of opioid prescription-drug seeking behavior and misuse of opioid drugs. Patient-provider (and therefore two-mode) prescription networks are utilized to generate network-based prescription-drug seeking metrics. The goal of this research is to improve the methods to identify early and intermittent signs of opioid-misuse behavior as well as patient groups who are at high risk of opioid use disorder and overdose.
